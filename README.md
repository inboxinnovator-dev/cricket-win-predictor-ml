# Cricket Match Win Predictor (Machine Learning)

## Description
This project predicts the probability of winning a cricket match based on historical match situations using machine learning.

## Problem
Cricket match outcomes depend on multiple dynamic factors such as runs remaining, wickets in hand, and required run rate. Manual prediction is difficult.

## Solution
A machine learning model trained on historical match data to predict win probability for a given match situation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression

## Features Used
- Runs left
- Balls left
- Wickets left
- Current run rate
- Required run rate

## Workflow
1. Load historical match data
2. Perform feature selection
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train logistic regression model
5. Evaluate accuracy
6. Predict win probability for new match scenarios

## Outcome
Demonstrates a real-world machine learning pipeline using historical data for predictive analytics.
