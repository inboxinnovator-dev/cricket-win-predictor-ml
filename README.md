Machine learning model to predict cricket match outcomes
# Cricket Win Predictor (Machine Learning)

## Description
This project predicts the probability of winning a cricket match using historical match data and machine learning.

## Problem
Predicting match outcomes manually is difficult due to multiple influencing factors like runs, wickets, overs, and target.

## Solution
A machine learning model built using Logistic Regression that predicts match outcomes based on match conditions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression

## Workflow
1. Load and clean data
2. Select important features
3. Split data into train and test sets
4. Train Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluate accuracy

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/predictor.py
